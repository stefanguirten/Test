It also receives interest and repayments on student loans as well as EU subsidies for education. 

Parents and/or students have to pay tuition fees for schools, colleges and universities, parent contributions and contributions for school activities. They also have to purchase books and materials, pay for transport from home to school and back for students who are not eligible for subsidised transport, pay for private tutoring, pay interest and repayments on student loans, and repay wrongfully received student grants, loans and allowances for school costs. Parents and/or students receive child care allowances, provisions for students with a disability and an allowance for school costs as well as student grants and loans and scholarships of companies.

Companies and non-profit organisations incur costs for supervising trainees and apprentices who combine learning with work experience. They also contribute to the cost of work related education of their employees and spend money on research that is outsourced to colleges for higher professional education and universities. Furthermore they contribute to the childcare allowances given to households and provide scholarships to students. Companies receive subsidies and tax benefits for the creation of apprenticeship places and trainee placements and for providing transport for pupils.

Organisations abroad contract universities in the Netherlands to undertake research for them. The European Union provides funds and subsidies for education to schools, colleges and universities as well as to the Dutch government. Foreign governments contribute to international schools in the Netherlands that operate under their nationality.

In this table tertiary education includes research and development, except for the indicator Expenditure on education institutions per student, excluding R&D.

The statistic on Education spending is compiled on a cash basis. This means that the education expenditure and revenues are allocated to the year in which they are paid out or received. However, the activity or transaction associated with the payment or receipt can take place in a different year.

Definition:

Regular education
Education that provides an officially recognised diploma, certificate, qualification or degree that is relevant for the labour market. This requires at least 400 hours of study, lasts at least 6 months and is not an in-company course. This education may be provided by government subsidised or private education institutions. Regular education begins at the age of 3 (pre-primary school) and may end with the highest achievable level of a master’s degree.

Explanation of symbols:

* 		: provisional figure
** 		: revised provisional figure

Figures are rounded off. Consequently, the sum of the detail data can deviate from the total.

For children from three years on preschool and day care offer an educational component in the activities of the children, meant to stimulate the development of the child. This includes preschool education for children with (an increased risk of) a (language) disadvantage. Primary general education is intended for children from the age of 4 to about 12 years, when they go on to secondary education."
"A048578";"Special needs primary education";"Special needs primary education and primary education in special schools for pupils from 4 to about 14 years of age. Special needs primary education is meant for children in need of more support and supervision than can be offered in regular primary education. Classes are often smaller than in regular primary education and children receive guidance by experts on their learning and educational difficulties. At both primary and secondary level some children receive special needs education in special schools. Education in special schools at primary level is for pupils requiring a special approach because of physical or mental disabilities, chronic illness or serious behavioural or learning difficulties."

Senior secondary vocational education (mbo) consists of occupational training whereby theory (the school-based track of senior secondary vocational education, bol) or practice (the apprenticeship-based track of senior secondary vocational education, bbl) is paramount. Of adult education, only secondary general education for adults (vavo) is included here. This is so-called second chance education, where adults can acquire a certificate or a pass at the highest level of preparatory secondary vocational education (vmbo), senior general secondary education (havo) or pre-university education (vwo)."

"A048426";"Higher professional education";"Education provided by colleges that concludes with an associate degree, bachelor's or master's degree. In addition to transferring theoretical knowledge, higher professional education is particularly aimed at developing skills and competence that are well-matched with the practical capabilities of students. Colleges also carry out research, aimed at achieving practical applications and solutions for businesses. It concerns both contract research conducted on behalf of third parties, and applied research which colleges must perform in accordance with their statutory duties."
"A048427";"University education";"Education provided by universities that concludes with a bachelor's, master's (formerly doctoral) or doctor's degree or a degree from university second-stage professional education. In addition to transferring theoretical knowledge, university education is particularly aimed at acquiring general skills and a scientific level of thinking. Another main task of universities is research. This research leads to fundamentally new insights, not specifically aimed at usability in industry or business.
